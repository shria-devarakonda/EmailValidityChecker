# EmailValidityChecker
Checks the validity of input emails using regex.

Enter a number on the first line, thats for the number of email ids youll enter, then enter your email ids line by line. 
If Your email id is deemed legit by my regex pattern, the mail will be printed to you.
Else,if  your mail seems invalid, it will not be printed back. Also might add a line to put the valid mails in a txt file.
